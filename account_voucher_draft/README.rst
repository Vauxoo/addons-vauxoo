Account Voucher Draft
=====================

This module modify the button Pay inside the wizard used to pay an HR Expense
(using an account voucher). This change is made to do not immediately change
the HR Expene to done state.

Notes
-----

- The ``Pay`` window is not really a wizard, is just a pop up window to create
  a account voucher related to the current hr expense document.
- The ``hr_expense_replenishment`` module can be found at addons-vauxoo
  repository.
