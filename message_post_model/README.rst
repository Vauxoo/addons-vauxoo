Message Post Log
================

This module adds an extended log in your model that appears in the mail.message
for each change made in the fields unlike the traditional way in wich Odoo did.

Features
--------

The extended log is added to your model's module in the following way:

        _name = "account.invoice"
        _inherit = ['account.invoice', 'message.post.show.all']

Also, if you need it, there is a testing module called message_post_test to
prove the funtionality.

Requirements:
-------------
- Go to https://github.com/Vauxoo/addons-vauxoo and download the repo in order to install message_post_model and message_post_test modules.
