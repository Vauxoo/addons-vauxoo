Add Read-Only Accounting Group
==============================

* Odoo does not come with a read-only accountant group out of the box, which
  is inconvenient when you need to have an external accountant go through your
  accounting records in Odoo.  This module adds a group 'Auditor Read-Only' so
  it's easy to grant an external accountant access to your Odoo system.

* This group inherits the group 'Employee', thus minimum level of
  create/write/delete rights will be granted for some non-accounting related
  models.
