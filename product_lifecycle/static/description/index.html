                This module apply a part of the product lifecycle management
                concept by extending the logic of the field
                <code class="docutils literal">Status</code> defined in
                the Odoo base modules and by adding a list of repaclement
                products that will be used as alternatives in purchase
                operations when a product is discontinued.

                This way we can differenciate when a specific variant is
