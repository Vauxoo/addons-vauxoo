Stock Move Description
======================

This module adds the field name in stock.move to the tree view in stock.move in
way that it can be easily differentiated from other records when there are
records with the same product_id and different Description

As a wizard is launched when receiving partial picking that wizard should
be able to show that description either as there is where you actually
perform reception of products
