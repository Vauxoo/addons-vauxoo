    OpenERP leaks of the feature necesary for some Latinamerican projects on
    accounting, we need to make the discount explÃ­cit on the account move line
    in the invoicing sale process because some taxes are exonerated with this
    amount and is necesary to declare taxes.

    Other accounting features is the credit notes, this are imputing amounts in
    debit columns, this is a bad practices for an accounting point of view,
    due to the generic information situation, what openERP Does actually is not
    wrong but several custormers ask us correct this behaviour, and we decide
    make it configurable.

    After install this module, you must tell in company if you want use it or not.

    Go to Administration > Companies and set the values to this feature on your
    company.

    Due to the generic issue, and in multilocalization enviroments, you will be
    able to have this feature in one company or another it depends of your legal
    context.

    We add 2 fields on product category and product objects, this fields are the
    accounts will be taken for this 2 features.

    Allowance Account: Account taken to make account move lines when discounts
    will be done.


    With this module 2 move lines per product will be done on sale invoice.
                                Debit | Credit
    ===========================================|
    account receivable            D            |
    discount account on product            D   | [Account Configured on Product or Category.]
    ===========================================|


    With this module 2 move lines per @Invoice@ when generic discount will be
    applied on invoice [Planified but not done yet] will be done on sale invoice.
