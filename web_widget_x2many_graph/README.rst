Usage
=====

Use this widget by saying::

    <field name="field_one2many_ids" widget="x2many_graph" color_field_name="HEXCOLOR">
        <graph >
            <field name="sequence"/> <!-- default name for field_x -->
             <!-- The rest of fields will be taken as Y -->
            <field name="value"/>
            <field name="sma"/>
            <field name="cma"/>
            <field name="wma"/>
        </graph>
    </field>

For example::

    <field name="value_ids" widget="x2many_graph" color_value="#2CA02C" color_sma="#FFBB78" color_cma="#1F77B4" color_wma="#D62728">
        <graph >
            <field name="sequence"/>
            <field name="value"/>
            <field name="sma"/>
            <field name="cma"/>
            <field name="wma"/>
        </graph>
    </field>

You can pass the following parameters:

field_x::

    The field which define X. (not mandatory you can set in your model a field named sequence).

field_label_x::

    Label for field_x

color_[[field_name]]::

    As much colors as fields you have in your graph view.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* nolabel is ignored, this image will never bring a label, by default simply use an extra separator.
* A graph will use always 100% of the width, pending the css dynamic attribute.
* The height is wired.
