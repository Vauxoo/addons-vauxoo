MRP Workorder Lot
=================

This module adds two features to the mrp module.

Work Order Lot
--------------

**First**, create a new model named ``Work Orders Lots`` (WOL) that represents a
block of Work Orders to be accomplished. The usual behavior in OpenERP when a
Manufacturing Order is confirmed is generating automatically the Work Orders,
one for every operation provided by the Routing set in the Manufacturing Order
form. This module changes this behavior by creating not Work Orders per se but
creating Work Order Lots. Every Work Order Lot holds a set of Work Orders
needed to achieve every routing operation.

The regular process to create the Work Orders has been modified too, instead
of creating one Work Order by every routing operation, it also takes into
account the product capacity in every relevant workcenters (workcenters
related to the current routing operations) and the product quantities
predisposed in every routing operation. This way a work order for a routing
operation will be split in N pieces to fulfill the workcenter capacity
condition like creating a batch procedure. For example::

    Manufacturing Order:
        Product: French Fries
        Qty to produce: 70 Units
        Raw Material: 1 kg Potatoes to produce 1 unit of French Fries
                      In total 70 kgs of potatoes to process.

    Routing Operations for French Fries:
        1. Clean potatoes   at Dishwasher workcenter
        2. Peel potatoes    at Table workcenter
        3. Nibble potatoes  at Grinder Machine workcenter
        4. Fry potatoes     at Stove workcenter

    Workcenter Capacities:
        Dishwasher:         40 kgs of Potatoes
        Grinder Machine:    20 kgs of Potatoes
        Stove:              30 kgs of Potatoes
        Table:              300 kgs of Potatoes

    For this case the bootle neck for workcenter capacity is in the Grinder
    Machine workcenter for a maximum of 20 kgs of Potatoes. Knowing that we
    need to process 70 kg of potatoes then it is necessary to create four work
    order lots: three of 20 kg and one for 10 kg of potatoes.

This new way to automatically create work order lots will also create as many
work orders as needed to respect the workcenter capacity. However this capacity
can be measured in two different criteria:

- **Avoid Production Bottleneck:** Will create the batch work orders taking
  into account the minimum capacity of all workcenter maximun capacities
  (Like the example above).
- **Maximize Workcenter Productivity / Minimizing Production Cost:** For every
  workcenter will create a batch of works orders that always explotes the
  product capacity of the workcenter::

    In this case will create:
    - Two work order Lots for operation 1
      (one Lot of 40 kg and one of 30 kg)
    - Four work order Lots for operation 2
      (three Lots of 20 kg and one of 10 kg)
    - Tree work order Lots for operation 3
      (two Lots of 30 kg and one of 10 Kg)
    - A work order lot of 70 Kg for operation 4 (300 Kg > 70 Kg)

**Note**: The second criterion **Maximize Workcenter Productivity /
          Minimizing Production Cost** basis is not yet fully implemented but
          is a work in process.

This criterion needs to be set by the user. The default is
*Avoid Production Bottleneck* option. To change this criterion set the
``Production Batch Process Type`` field either go to
``Settings Menu > Companies Sidebar Section > Companies Menu > (Select a
Company from the list) > In Configuration Tab > At Logistics Section`` or go to
``Settings Menu > Configuration Sidebar Section > Manufacturing Menu >
Manufacturing Order Section > Planning Section``.

Consume and Produce Processes
-----------------------------

**Second**, With the new concept of Work Order Lots we are attaching the paradigm of
consuming raw material in lots instead of consuming it in a swept. In order to
achieve this feature we have integrated the MRP Consume Produce module to
manage in a more real way the production processes. These consume and produce
processes have been adapted to manage the Work Order Lots instead of raw
material per se. This functionality renders to be helpful because in real life
the processes did not happen all at once.

**Note**: The MRP Consume Produce module (``mrp_consume_produce``) can be
          found in lp:~vauxoo/addons-vauxoo/7.0

If you install this module you need to active some settings:

- Active ``Manage Routings`` and ``Manage Multiple Units of Measure``
  checkboxs at the ``Settings Menu > Users Sidebar Section > Users Menu >
  (Select a User) > User Form Access Rights Tab  > Technical Settings
  Section`` to show Workcenter and Routing menu.
- Active the ``Track serial number on products`` checkbox in
  ``Settings Menu > Configuration Sidebar Section > Warehouse Menu >
  Traceability Section`` to show the product serial numbers.
- Active the ``MRP / Button Consume-Produce`` checkbox in
  ``Settings Menu > Users Sidebar Section > Users Menu > (Select a User) >
  User Form Access Rights Tab > Other Section`` to active the groups permission
  to invidually consume and produce.
