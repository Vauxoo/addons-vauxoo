This module:
*) Adds a new state to the sale order model, committed
*) Adds a new activity to the sale order workflow, commit
*) Adds two new transitions from draft to commit,
    -) One which could force commitment of sale order,
    -) The other will check if any product does not overflow the availability
*) Modifies the existing Transition from draft to router
and changes it from commit to router.

*) Adds a wizard so that it is possible to assign groups to the newly transitions.
*) Adds two fields to the product.product model:
    -) qty_committed: amounts the quantity of products in sale orders with state committed
    -) qty_uncommitted: amounts the quantity of available to commit
    this amount is, qty_available + outgoing - qty_committed
