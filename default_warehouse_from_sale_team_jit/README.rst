Default Warehouse from Sales Team + Just In Time Scheduling
===========================================================

This module is just to ensure the module "Default Warehouse from Sales Team"
works correctly when sold products are configured to be reserved immediately
after sales order confirmation, i.e. module "Just In Time Scheduling"
(``procurement_jit``) is installed.

This helps to avoid access errors when product reservation of sale orders
requires access to warehouses not allowed to current user on their sales teams.
