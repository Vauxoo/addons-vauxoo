Account Analytic Required
=========================

This module adds an option "analytic policy" on Accounts.

You have the choice between 3 policies : always, never and optional. For
example, if you want to have an analytic account on all your expenses, set
the policy to "always" for the account that represent the "expense" ; then, if
you try to save an account move line with an account of type "expense" without
analytic account, you will get an proper error message.
