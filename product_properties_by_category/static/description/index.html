                This module add a new section called "Product Property" in the
                Product Category form view to manage a group of common default
                values to be set at the Products that belongs to the Category.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you change the Internal Category of the Product the
                default values defined in the Category for the Products will
                be set. This configuration is set but is not mandatory, you
                can manually change the Products fields as you need.

            For the current version, only works with the "Call For Bids" Product field.
            When you update your Products Internal Category the "Call For Bids" field
            in the Product will be updated with the default value given to the field
            "Call For Bids" defined in the Product Category. If the Product Category
            have not defined a default value for "Call For Bids" then will look into the
            parent Product Category an so on until find a default value. If not default
            value is set on any of the parent product category then the "Call For Bids"
            field in Product will be set to False.
