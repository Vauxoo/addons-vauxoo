        Why this inheritance?

        This method always compute the product price, from product currency
        (mostly the same company currency) into pricelist currency. When the
        pricelist item is based on cost in USD is necessary that currency
        conversion is made from USD currency. By this reason we must go back
        the conversion made in super and then made a conversion from USD
        currency to the pricelist currency to get the expected price when the
        pricelist item is based on cost in USD.

        Returns: dict{product_id: (price, suitable_rule) for given pricelist}
