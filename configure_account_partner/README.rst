Configure Account to partners
=============================

Configure Accounts On imported Partners:

Background:
-----------

When you import a lot of partners from several sources, It is so common that
all of them are setted with a payable and receiveble account by default, with
this wizard you can fix this quickly one time you upload all partners.

1. Creates a wizard where you choose an account and write all partners
that are customers and selected on the wizard with this selected account.

2. Clean the company_id on the property to be able to use the same <head></head>
on all reports.

**TODO:** This feature is so wired, when we fix the correct behaviour this feature
must be removed.
