Description field on attribute
------------------------------

Add a module description of type text to the attribute Value model, in order to 
have a place to set generic long reusable description.

This field is necesary to be used when you need a fixed explanation related to 
your attribute, helping you use this help on all reports and views necesary 
for sales / purchase, for example on e - commerce, this is a pivote feature to 
avoid make too big to be used to expend Views / reports module per module.
