                A new field "sequence" was added to the lines of the purchase
                order for automatic enumerate lines when they are created from
                the purchase order. The sequence field exploits the special
                field functionality allowing drag and drop the line to
                re-enumerate.

                This sequence is a incremental positive number greater or
                equal to 1. It increments one by one. You can also change the
                generate sequence number by hand to set the sequence number
                you want. After you save the purchase order lines will be
                re-ordered with the sequence value given.

                Also the sequence field is validate to be unique per purchase
                order so the sequence number to identificate lines
                can not be repeat into the lines of a purchase order.
