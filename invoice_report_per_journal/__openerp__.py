    """
Adds a "Report" field on the journal model and a "Print Invoice" button on the customer invoices view which calls
a wizard to print an invoice on a report per journal enviroment.

This module allows the generation of txt reports using the following convention:

* Must be a report wizard type to return the txt report.
* The report wizard type must have the same name as his counterpart in pdf format concatenating the following string ' txt' in the report name.
    
In this way the module generates both reports, making available for download the report txt.
